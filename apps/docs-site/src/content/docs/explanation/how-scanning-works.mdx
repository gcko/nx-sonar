Sonar is a powerful tool for code quality analysis, offering insights into code health, bugs, vulnerabilities, and more.
This document explains how scanning works with nx-sonar and Sonar.

## What is Included?

### Dependency Graph

Working in a monorepo typically involves an application project and imported library projects. One of Nx's most
important features is to calculate how projects depend on each other called the [dependency graph](https://nx.dev/nx-api/nx/documents/dep-graph#graph).
The dependency graph is core to how the nx-sonar Nx Plugin can determine which projects to include in a given scan.

There are three kinds of dependencies the graph can calculate:

- [Static](https://nx.dev/extending-nx/recipes/project-graph-plugins#static-dependencies) - a hardcoded import
- [Dynamic](https://nx.dev/extending-nx/recipes/project-graph-plugins#dynamic-dependencies) - a runtime import (e.g. lazy-loaded routes)
- [Implicit](https://nx.dev/extending-nx/recipes/project-graph-plugins#implicit-dependencies) - not associated with any file or code

Here is an example of the dependency graph for a project `app` to be scanned:

![dep-graph](../../../assets/dep-graph.png)

The project `app` has the following dependencies that will be included in the scan:

- 4 static (`app`, `lib-a`, `lib-b`, `lib-c`)
- 1 dynamic (`lib-d`)
- 1 implicit (`lib-e`)

Based on the dependency graph above, the following is added to the Sonar analysis:

```shell
Included sources paths: apps/app/src,libs/lib-a/src,libs/lib-b/src,libs/lib-c/src,libs/lib-d/src,libs/lib-e/src
Included lcov paths: coverage/apps/app,coverage/libs/lib-a,coverage/libs/lib-b,coverage/libs/lib-c,coverage/libs/lib-d,coverage/libs/lib-e
```

### Source Code

The source code is the code which, presumably, is included in your production build output. This is the code that
developers would like scanned to find bugs, code smells, etc.

The source code paths are included in the scanner by using the respective `project.json`'s
[sourceRoot](https://nx.dev/nx-api/devkit/documents/ProjectConfiguration#sourceroot) property:

<Code
  code={projectJson}
  lang="json"
  title="apps/app/project.json"
  mark={['"apps/app/src"']}
/>

:::caution
Source code paths should not be overridden as this is core feature of the plugin which uses the dependency graph
:::

:::caution
The scanner will default to using project root (e.g., `apps/app`) if `sourceRoot` is not present since it can be an
optional project configuration property
:::

### Unit Test Coverage

Unit test coverage refers to a metric used in software development to measure the extent to which the source code of a
program is executed when its unit tests run. It quantifies the amount of source code that is tested by unit tests.

The unit test coverage report (lcov) is determined based on the supported [Jest](https://nx.dev/nx-api/jest/executors/jest#nxjestjest)
or [Vitest](https://nx.dev/nx-api/vite/executors/test) configurations:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Jest">
    <Code
      code={jestConfig}
      lang="typescript"
      title="libs/lib-a/jest.config.ts"
      mark={["'../../coverage/libs/lib-a'"]}
    />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Vitest">
    <Code
      code={viteConfig}
      lang="typescript"
      title="libs/lib-e/vitest.config.ts"
      mark={["'../../coverage/libs/lib-e'"]}
    />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::caution
Coverage paths should not be overridden as this is core feature of the plugin which uses the dependency graph

## Scanner Scanner

The Nx plugin wraps the [sonarqube-scanner](https://github.com/SonarSource/sonar-scanner-npm) npm package.
Options for the scanner are passed in via the [executor properties](/reference/executors/scan/#options) into the
[`getScannerOptions()`](https://github.com/gcko/nx-sonar/blob/main/packages/nx-sonar/src/executors/scan/utils/utils.ts) method of the plugin.

The following sections are explain how to pass other options into the scanner outside the executor options:

### Sonar Environment Variables

You can pass extra options to the scanner by using environment variables like so:

```shell
SONAR_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG npx nx sonar my-app
```

Will be combined into the period-delimited string as `sonar.log.level=DEBUG`

### Extra Property

The scan executor offers an [extra](/reference/executors/scan/#extra) property in which other sonar scanner options
can be passed into the scanner that the scan executor doesn't officially support.

<Code
  code={extraProjectJson}
  lang="json"
  title="apps/app/project.json"
  mark="extra"
/>
